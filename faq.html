<dl>
<dt>What is the history of iperf3, and what is the difference between iperf2 and iperf3?</dt><dd><p>iperf2 was orphaned in the late 2000s at version 2.0.5, despite some
known bugs and issues. After spending some time trying to fix
iperf2’s problems, ESnet decided by 2010 that a new, simpler tool
was needed, and began development of iperf3. The goal was make the
tool as simple as possible, so others could contribute to the code
base. For this reason, it was decided to make the tool single
threaded, and not worry about backwards compatibility with
iperf2. Many of the feature requests for iperf3 came from the
perfSONAR project (<a class="reference external" href="http://www.perfsonar.net">http://www.perfsonar.net</a>).</p>
<p>Then in 2014, Bob (Robert) McMahon from Broadcom restarted
development of iperf2 (See
<a class="reference external" href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/iperf2/">https://sourceforge.net/projects/iperf2/</a>). He fixed many of the
problems with iperf2, and added a number of new features similar to
iperf3. iperf2.0.8, released in 2015, made iperf2 a useful tool. iperf2’s
current development is focused is on using UDP for latency testing, as well
as broad platform support.</p>
<p>In 2023, iperf3 was modified and restructured to support
multi-threading, so that it uses one thread per test stream. This
allows it to use multiple CPU cores during tests, which in turn
permit it to keep up with continually increasing network link and
path bandwidths across the backbones of ESnet and other network
providers.</p>
<p>As of this writing (2024), both iperf2 and iperf3 are being actively
(although independently) developed.  We recommend being familiar with
both tools, and use whichever tool’s features best match your needs.</p>
<p>A feature comparison of iperf2, iperf3, and nuttcp is available at:
<a class="reference external" href="https://fasterdata.es.net/performance-testing/network-troubleshooting-tools/throughput-tool-comparision/">https://fasterdata.es.net/performance-testing/network-troubleshooting-tools/throughput-tool-comparision/</a></p>
</dd>
<dt>iperf3 parallel stream performance is much less than iperf2. Why?</dt><dd><p>Versions of iperf3 before version 3.16 were all single threaded, and
iperf2 is multi-threaded. This could result in a performance gap
because iperf3 was only able to use one CPU core on a host, which
turned into a bottleneck when trying to do high bitrate tests
(faster than about 25 Gbps).</p>
<p>Beginning with version 3.16, iperf3 is multi-threaded, which allows
it to take advantage of multiple CPU cores during a test (one thread
per stream). iperf3 has been observed to send and receive
approximately 160Gbps on a 200Gbps path in a test involving multiple
TCP flows, with little or no tuning.</p>
<p>Prior to multi-threading support in iperf3, one might need to use
the method described <a class="reference external" href="https://fasterdata.es.net/performance-testing/network-troubleshooting-tools/iperf/multi-stream-iperf3/">here</a>
to achieve faster speeds.</p>
</dd>
<dt>I’m trying to use iperf3 on Windows, but having trouble. What should I do?</dt><dd><p>iperf3 is not officially supported on Windows, but iperf2 is. We
recommend you use iperf2.</p>
<p>Some people are using Cygwin to run iperf3 in Windows, but not all
options will work.  Some community-provided binaries of iperf3 for
Windows exist.</p>
</dd>
<dt>How can I build a statically-linked executable of iperf3?</dt><dd><p>There are a number of reasons for building an iperf3 executable with
no dependencies on any shared libraries.  Unfortunately this isn’t
quite a straight-forward process.</p>
<p>The steps below have nominally been tested on CentOS 7.4, but
can probably be adapted for use with other Linux distributions:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>If necessary, install the static C libraries; for CentOS this is
the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">glibc-static</span></code> package.</p></li>
<li><p>If OpenSSL is installed, be sure that its static libraries are
also installed, from the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">openssl-static</span></code> package.</p></li>
<li><p>Be sure that <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">lksctp-*</span></code> packages are not installed, because
as of this writing, there do not appear to be any static
libraries available for SCTP.</p></li>
<li><p>Configure iperf3 thusly: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">configure</span> <span class="pre">&quot;LDFLAGS=--static&quot;</span>
<span class="pre">--disable-shared</span></code> These options are necessary to disable the
generation of shared libraries and link the executable
statically.  For iperf-3.8 or later, configuring as <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">configure</span>
<span class="pre">--enable-static-bin</span></code> is another, shorter way to accomplish
this.  If SCTP is installed on the system it might also be
necessary to pass the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--without-sctp</span></code> flag at configure
time.</p></li>
<li><p>Compile as normal.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>It appears that for FreeBSD (tested on FreeBSD 11.1-RELEASE), only
the last two steps are needed to produce a static executable.</p>
</dd>
<dt>How can I build on a system that doesn’t support profiled executables?</dt><dd><p>This problem has been noted by users attempting to build iperf3 for
Android systems, as well as some recent versions of macOS.
There are several workarounds. In order from least
effort to most effort:</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p>Beginning with iperf-3.8, profiled executables are actually not
built by default, so this question becomes somewhat moot.  Pass
the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--enable-profiling</span></code> flag to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">configure</span></code> to build
profiled executables.</p></li>
<li><p>In iperf-3.6 and iperf-3.7, the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--disable-profiling</span></code> flag can be
passed to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">configure</span></code> to disable the building of profiled
object files and the profiled executable.</p></li>
<li><p>At the time the linking of the iperf3 profiled executable fails,
the “normal” iperf3 executable is probably already created. So if
you are willing to accept the error exit from the make process
(and a little bit of wasted work on the build host), you might
not need to do anything.</p></li>
<li><p>After the configure step, there will be a definition in
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">src/Makefile</span></code> that looks like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>noinst_PROGRAMS = t_timer$(EXEEXT) t_units$(EXEEXT) t_uuid$(EXEEXT) \
  iperf3_profile$(EXEEXT)
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>If you edit it to look like this, it will disable the build of the profiled iperf3:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>noinst_PROGRAMS = t_timer$(EXEEXT) t_units$(EXEEXT) t_uuid$(EXEEXT)
</pre></div>
</div>
</li>
<li><p>Similar to item 2 above, but more permanent…if you edit
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">src/Makefile.am</span></code> and change the line reading like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">noinst_PROGRAMS</span>         <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">t_timer</span> <span class="n">t_units</span> <span class="n">t_uuid</span> <span class="n">iperf3_profile</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>To look like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">noinst_PROGRAMS</span>         <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">t_timer</span> <span class="n">t_units</span> <span class="n">t_uuid</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>And then run <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">./bootstrap.sh</span></code>, that will regenerate the project
Makefiles to make the exclusion of the profiled iperf3 executable
permanent (within that source tree).</p>
</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dt>I’m seeing quite a bit of unexpected UDP loss. Why?</dt><dd><p>First, confirm you are using iperf 3.1.5 or higher. There was an
issue with the default UDP send size that was fixed in
3.1.5. Second, try adding the flag <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">-w2M</span></code> to increase the socket
buffer sizes. That seems to make a big difference on some hosts.</p>
</dd>
<dt>iperf3 UDP does not seem to work at bandwidths less than 100Kbps. Why?</dt><dd><p>You’ll need to reduce the default packet length to get UDP rates of less that 100Kbps. Try <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">-l100</span></code>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>TCP throughput drops to (almost) zero during a test, what’s going on?</dt><dd><p>A drop in throughput to almost zero, except maybe for the first
reported interval(s), may be related to problems in NIC TCP Offload,
which is used to offload TCP functionality to the NIC (see
<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCP_offload_engine">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCP_offload_engine</a>). The goal of TCP
Offload is to save main CPU performance, mainly in the areas of
segmentation and reassembly of large packets and checksum
computation.</p>
<p>When TCP packets are sent with the “Don’t Fragment” flag set, which
is the recommended setting, segmentation is done by the TCP stack
based on the reported next hop MSS in the ICMP Fragmentation Needed
message. With TCP Offload, active segmentation is done by the NIC on
the sending side, which is known as TCP Segmentation offload (TSO)
or in Windows as Large Send Offload (LSO). It seems that there are
TSO/LSO implementations which for some reason ignore the reported
MSS and therefore don’t perform segmentation. In these cases, when
large packets are sent, e.g. the default iperf3 128KB (131,072
bytes), iperf3 will show that data was sent in the first interval,
but since the packets don’t get to the server, no ack is received
and therefore no data is sent in the following intervals. It may
happen that after certain timeout the main CPU will re-send the
packet by re-segmenting it, and in these cases data will get to the
server after a while. However, it seems that segmentation is not
automatically continued with the next packet, so the data transfer
rate be very low.</p>
<p>The recommended solution in such a case is to disable TSO/LSO, at
least on the relevant port. See for example:
<a class="reference external" href="https://atomicit.ca/kb/articles/slow-network-speed-windows-10/">https://atomicit.ca/kb/articles/slow-network-speed-windows-10/</a>. If
that doesn’t help then “Don’t Fragment” TCP flag may be
disabled. See for example:
<a class="reference external" href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/900926/recommended-tcp-ip-settings-for-wan-links-with-a-mtu-size-of-less-than">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/900926/recommended-tcp-ip-settings-for-wan-links-with-a-mtu-size-of-less-than</a>. However,
note that disabling the “Don’t Fragment” flag may cause other
issues.</p>
<p>To test whether TSO/LSO may be the problem, do the following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>If different machine configurations are used for the client and
server, try the iperf3 reverse mode (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">-R</span></code>). If TSO/LSO is only
enabled on the client machine, this test should succeed.</p></li>
<li><p>Reduce the sending length to a small value that should not require
segmentation, using the iperf3 <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">-l</span></code> option, e.g. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">-l</span> <span class="pre">512</span></code>. It
may also help to reduce the MTU by using the iperf3 <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">-M</span></code> option,
e.g. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">-M</span> <span class="pre">1460</span></code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Using tools like Wireshark, identify the required MSS in the ICMP
Fragmentation Needed messages (if reported). Run tests with the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">-l</span></code> value set to 2 times the MSS and then 4 times, 6 times,
etc. With TSO/LSO issue in each test the throughput should be
reduced more. It may help to increase the testing time beyond the
default 10 seconds to better see the behavior (iperf3 <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">-t</span></code>
option).</p></li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>What congestion control algorithms are supported?</dt><dd><p>On Linux, run this command to see the available congestion control
algorithms (note that some algorithms are packaged as kernel
modules, which must be loaded before they can be used):</p>

</dd>
<dt>I’m using the –fq-rate flag, but it does not seem to be working. Why?</dt><dd><p>You need to add ‘net.core.default_qdisc = fq’ to /etc/sysctl.conf for that option to work.</p>
</dd>
<dt>I’m having trouble getting iperf3 to work on Windows, Android, etc. Where can I get help?</dt><dd><p>iperf3 only supports Linux, FreeBSD, and OSX. For other platforms we recommend using iperf2.</p>
</dd>
<dt>I managed to get a Windows executable built, but why do I get a BSOD on Windows 7?</dt><dd><p>There seems to be a bug in Windows 7 where running iperf3 from a
network filesystem can cause a system crash (in other words Blue
Screen of Death, or BSOD).  This is a Windows bug addressed in kb2839149:</p>

<dt>Why can’t I run a UDP client with no server?</dt><dd><p>This is potentially dangerous, and an attacker could use this for a

</ul>
</dd>
<dt>My receiver didn’t get all the bytes that got sent but there was no loss.  Huh?</dt><dd><p>iperf3 uses a control connection between the client and server to
manage the start and end of each test.  Sometimes the commands on
the control connection can be received and acted upon before all of
the test data has been processed.  Thus the test ends with data
still in flight.  This effect can be significant for short (a few
seconds) tests, but is probably negligible for longer tests.</p>
</dd>
<dt>A file sent using the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">-F</span></code> option got corrupted…what happened?</dt><dd><p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">-F</span></code> option to iperf3 is not a file transfer utility.  It’s a
way of testing the end-to-end performance of a file transfer,
including filesystem and disk overheads.  So while the test will
mimic an actual file transfer, the data stored to disk may not be
the same as what was sent.  In particular, the file size will be
rounded up to the next larger multiple of the transfer block size,
and for UDP tests, iperf’s metadata (containing timestamps and
sequence numbers) will overwrite the start of every UDP packet
payload.</p>
</dd>
<dt>I have a question regarding iperf3…what’s the best way to get help?</dt><dd><p>Searching on the Internet is a good first step.
<a class="reference external" href="http://stackoverflow.com/">http://stackoverflow.com/</a> has a number of iperf3-related questions
and answers, but a simple query into your favorite search engine can
also yield some results.</p>
<p>There is a mailing list nominally used for iperf3 development,
<a class="reference external" href="mailto:iperf-dev&#37;&#52;&#48;googlegroups&#46;com">iperf-dev<span>&#64;</span>googlegroups<span>&#46;</span>com</a>.</p>
<p>We discourage the use of the iperf3 issue tracker on GitHub for
support questions.  Actual bug reports, enhancement requests, or
pull requests are encouraged, however.</p>
