These releases address a security issue that could cause a crash of an
iperf3 process (it could theoretically lead to a remote code
execution).  Although the risk for common use cases is believed to be
low, all users are encouraged to update to these versions or newer as
soon as possible.  More information on the security vulnerability can
be found in the following ESnet Software Security Advisory:

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/esnet/security/master/cve-2016-4303/esnet-secadv-2016-0001.txt.asc

This release fixes a few minor bugs.

2015-10-16:  iperf3 Development Status
......................................

Beginning with the release of iperf 3.1, ESnet plans to support iperf3
in "maintenance mode".  At this point, we have no definite plans for
further iperf3 releases, and ESnet will be providing a very limited
amount of resources for support and development, going forward.
However, ESnet could issue new iperf3 releases to deal with security
issues or high-impact bug fixes.

Requests for support, enhancements, and questions should best be
directed to the iperf-dev mailing list.  ESnet would be open to adding
project members/committers from the community, in case there are
developers who are interested in doing more active work with iperf3
and/or supporting the user base.


2015-10-16:  iperf-3.1 released

This maintenance release fixes an issue for a situation in which
attempting a UDP test with pathologically large (and illegal) packet
sizes could put the iperf3 server in a state where it would stop
accepting connections from clients, thus causing the clients to crash
when interrupted.


2014-09-30:  iperf-3.0.8 released

This maintenance release includes the following bug fixes:

* Several problems with the -B option have been fixed.  Also, API
  calls have been added to libiperf to extend this functionality to
  API clients.

* Some portability fixes for OpenBSD and Solaris have been merged from
  the mainline.

As always, more details can be found in the ``RELNOTES.md`` file in
the source distribution.

2014-06-16:  Project documentation on GitHub Pages
..................................................

iperf3 project documentation can now be found at:

| URL:  http://software.es.net/iperf/

This is a GitHub Pages site.  In an ongoing series of steps, content

This is the third maintenance release of iperf 3, with few more
enhancements and bug fixes.  Highlights:

* A timing issue which caused measurement intervals to be wrong with
  TCP tests on lossy networks has been fixed.

* It is now possible to get (most of) the server-side output at
  the client by using the ``--get-server-output`` flag.

* A number of bugs with ``--json`` output have been fixed.

A more extensive list of changes can always be found in the
``RELNOTES.md`` file in the source distribution.

Note:  An iperf-3.0.4 release was planned and tagged, but not
officially released.

2014-06-10:  New iperf3 download site
.....................................

iperf3 downloads are now hosted on a new server at ESnet:

| URL:  http://downloads.es.net/pub/iperf/

Going forward, new releases will be made available in this directory.
Older releases will, at least for now, continue to also be available
at the previous location.

This is the second maintenance release of iperf 3.0, containing a few bug fixes and enhancements, notably:

* The structure of the JSON output is more consistent between the
  cases of one stream and multiple streams.

* The example programs once again build correctly.

* A possible buffer overflow related to error output has been fixed.
  (This is not believed to be exploitable.)

More information on changes can be found in the ``RELNOTES.md``

**Note:**  Due to a mistake in the release process, the distribution tarball referred to above is actually not compressed, despite its ``.tar.gz`` extension.  Instead it is an uncompressed tar archive.  The file checksum is correct, as are the file contents.

This version is a maintenance release that
fixes a number of bugs, many reported by users, adds a few minor
enhancements, and tracks the migration of the iperf3 project to
GitHub.  Of particular interest:

* Build / runtime fixes for CentOS 5, MacOS 10.9, and FreeBSD.

* TCP snd_cwnd output on Linux in the default output format.

* libiperf is now built as both a shared and static library; by
  default, the iperf3 binary links to the shared library.

More information on changes can be found in the ``RELNOTES.md``
file in the source distribution.

During development, there were various distributions of the source
code unofficially released carrying a 3.0.0 version number.  Because
of the possibility for confusion, this first public release of iperf3
was numbered 3.0.1.
