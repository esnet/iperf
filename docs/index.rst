iperf3
======

The iperf series of tools perform active measurements to determine the
maximum achievable bandwidth on IP networks.  It supports tuning of
various parameters related to timing, protocols, and buffers.  For
each test it reports the measured throughput, loss, and other
parameters.

This version, sometimes referred to as iperf3, is a redesign of an
original version developed at NLANR / DAST.  iperf3 is a new
implementation from scratch, with the goal of a smaller, simpler code
base, and a library version of the functionality that can be used in
other programs. iperf3 also incorporates a number of features found in
other tools such as nuttcp and netperf, but were missing from the
original iperf.  These include, for example, a zero-copy mode and
optional JSON output.  Note that iperf3 is *not* backwards compatible
with the original iperf.

Primary development for iperf3 takes place on Ubuntu Linux, FreeBSD,
and macOS.  At this time, these are the only officially
supported platforms, however there have been some reports of success
with OpenBSD, Android, and other Linux distributions.

iperf3 is principally developed by `ESnet <http://www.es.net/>`_ /
`Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory <http://www.lbl.gov/>`_.  It
is released under a three-clause BSD license.

iperf2 is no longer being developed by its original maintainers.
However, beginning in 2014, another developer began fixing bugs and
enhancing functionality, and generating releases of iperf2.  Both
projects (as of late 2017) are currently being developed actively, but
independently.  More information can be found in the :ref:`faq`.
